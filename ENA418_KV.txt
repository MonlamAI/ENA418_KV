Infinite Knowables: A Supplication Offered at the Request of Jutsa Pende Gentle-voiced (Jamyang) and seeing all infinite knowables, Great treasury of unequalled wisdom and love (Khyentse), heir of the Buddha, Lord (Wangpo) of learnedness and realization, vajra holder, Sun Who Teaches the Sciences-to you I pray. Through perfected hearing, reflection, and meditation, abiding in discipline; Through the magnificent activities of exposition, debate, and composition; And through renunciation, bodhicitta, ripening and liberating practices, and union, You engage in the two benefits for oneself and others-I supplicate to you. Through the blessing of supplicating thus, May the stainless teaching of the victorious ones flourish in the ten directions, May the supreme holders of the teachings live for hundreds of eons, And may you grant the auspiciousness of increasing the virtuous signs of benefits and happiness. At the behest of Pende Zangpo, who offered me an auspicious silk scarf, I, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, one who is free of activities, wrote down whatever came to mind. May it become virtuous and auspicious.
